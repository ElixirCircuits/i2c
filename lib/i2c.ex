  Scan the I2C bus for devices by performing a read at each device address

  WARNING: This is intended to be a debugging aid. Reading bytes from devices
  can advance internal state machines and might cause them to get out of sync
  with other code. Also the I2C device file is (re)opened, 
  which generates a new file descriptor, which will invalidate an existing 'fd'.

  The return value is a list of device addresses that were detected on the

  converted the list to an Erlang string. Run `i v()` to get information about
  the return value and look at the raw string representation for addresses.
